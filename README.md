## Why?!

My wife and I play a game called WordScapes. I was on level 200 or so, and I found out she was 800+, that's why.

## What does it do?!

The file words.txt is our dictionary, and it contains over 190,000 words (feel free to add more!). The user simply enters their combination of random letters into the input box, and the application finds all the possible words for you. There's a nifty little slider that will allow you filter out words by their character length.

### Installing

No need to install anything, build the solution, and run the executable.
